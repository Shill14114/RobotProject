## Ordering Instructions
### Beta Layout
We have mostly been ordering the Micro Driver boards from [BetaLayout](https://us.beta-layout.com/pcb/).
Beta Layout has the permission to replicate our MicroDriver v2 board order for anybody who is interested - they ship worldwide.

Send an email to info.de@beta-layout.com and ask for a quote for replicating the MicroDriver v2 boards according to the order number **AU-201909/38760**.

They will send you a quote for producing the boards and for the placing and soldering service *- NOT including the cost of the electronic components.*

After you have placed the order for the boards Beta Layout will search for the components and will send you the component list with the actual component prices for your approval. For our last orders the component price was around 50€ per board.

We order the boards with all the components placed and soldered - except for the precision resistors and the Hirose connectors. The soldering of those components is described [below](#soldering-work).

### MacroFab

In the US we have also successfully ordered the Micro Driver Boards from [MacroFab](https://macrofab.com/).

# Soldering Work

The MicroDrivers come without any connectors (for power wires, encoders, spi and motor wires). These have to been added. In addition, six resistors have to been soldered on the back of the MicroDriver.

For the encoder connectors, it's possible to use either [Hirose DF13 Straight Pin Headers](../details/details_components.md#hirose-df13-straight-pin-headers) or the [Hirose DF13 Right Angle Pin Headers](../details/details_components.md#hirose-df13-right-angle-pin-headers)

## Resistor Soldering
The six [precision resistors](../details/details_components.md#precision-resistors) needs to be soldered on the back of the MicroDriver.<br>
**Trick:** Use some solder at the tip to initially fix the resistor a bit. Then solder the other side and fix the initial side in the end properly.

## Hirose Connector Soldering

<img src="images/micro_driver_stack_1.jpg" width="400"><br>*Micro Driver Stack with right angle Hirose connectors.*<br>

We recommend to use the right angle Hirose connectors for the encoders and the SPI communication if the cards are mounted in a stack. This allows for connecting and disconnecting the encoder and SPI wires without disassembling the stack.

The **right angle Hirose connectors** are mounted to the **bottom side** of the micro driver boards as shown in the picture below.
The **straight Hirose connectors** are mounted on the **top side** of the micro driver boards. That way the pin assignment is identical and both connector options are compatible with the [Actuator Module Wiring Interface](../details/details_wiring.md#actuator-module-wiring).

## Flashing

The MicroDriver boards are flashed using a JTAG emulator connected via USB.<br> The emulator is connected to the MicroDriver using the connector cable described below.

## Wiring MicroDriver <-> JTAG Emulator

Note: A long wire might cause communication problems when attempting to flash the MicroDriver. A cable length of 10 cm worked well for us.
